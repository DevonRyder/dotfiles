# :heavy_dollar_sign: Welcome to My Dotfiles!
These are my current dotfiles for my `Antergos` system using `i3-gaps` and `Polybar` The configurations here are very much tailored to my system, and as such may not be suitable to your setup. With that said, feel free to copy any configuration setting you wish!
